description: '"An Authoritative Multiplayer Framework for Node.js" This looks interesting.
  I''ve been rolling my own such websocket server for playing simple boardgames with
  friends. This looks like where I might get to with another 5 years of solid and
  diligent work. For my next game I might ditch my DIY server and switch to this if
  the setup experience is lightweight enough.'
